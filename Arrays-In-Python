#  Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python lists can be used instead.

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
print(cars)   #     ['Ford', 'Volvo', 'BMW']
print(cars[0])      #   Ford
x = cars[0]
print(x)     #   Ford

for t in cars:
    print(t)    #   Ford     Volvo      BMW
    
#   Modify the value of the first array item:

cars[0] = "Toyota"
print(cars)   #      ['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'BMW']

print(len(cars))      #    3
#   You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.

#   Add one more element to the cars array:

print(cars.append("Honda"))     #    None     " its means doesn;t return anything"
print(cars)        #       ['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'BMW', 'Honda']

#  You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.
#   Delete the second element of the cars array:
# print(cars.pop(1))         #    Volvo     it'll   return 
print(cars.remove("Volvo"))  #   None         " its means doesn;t return anything" 
#cars.pop(1)
print(cars)    #    ['Toyota', 'BMW', 'Honda']

#  Note: The remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value.
#   it wont return anything but pop() method return remove value

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.

Method      Description
append()    Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()    Removes all the elements from the list
copy()    Returns a copy of the list
count()    Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()    Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()    Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()    Adds an element at the specified position
pop()    Removes the element at the specified position
remove()    Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()    Reverses the order of the list
sort()    Sorts the list

Python MySQL Update Table
Update Table
You can update existing records in a table by using the "UPDATE" statement:

Example
Overwrite the address column from "Valley 345" to "Canyoun 123":

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "UPDATE customers SET address = 'Canyon 123' WHERE address = 'Valley 345'"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")
Important!: Notice the statement: mydb.commit(). It is required to make the changes, otherwise no changes are made to the table.

Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE syntax: The WHERE clause specifies which record or records that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated!

Prevent SQL Injection
It is considered a good practice to escape the values of any query, also in update statements.

This is to prevent SQL injections, which is a common web hacking technique to destroy or misuse your database.

The mysql.connector module uses the placeholder %s to escape values in the delete statement:

Example
Escape values by using the placholder %s method:

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "UPDATE customers SET address = %s WHERE address = %s"
val = ("Valley 345", "Canyon 123")

mycursor.execute(sql, val)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")

Python MySQL Join
Join Two or More Tables
You can combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them, by using a JOIN statement.

Consider you have a "users" table and a "products" table:

users
{ id: 1, name: 'John', fav: 154},
{ id: 2, name: 'Peter', fav: 154},
{ id: 3, name: 'Amy', fav: 155},
{ id: 4, name: 'Hannah', fav:},
{ id: 5, name: 'Michael', fav:}
products
{ id: 154, name: 'Chocolate Heaven' },
{ id: 155, name: 'Tasty Lemons' },
{ id: 156, name: 'Vanilla Dreams' }
These two tables can be combined by using users' fav field and products' id field.

Example
Join users and products to see the name of the users favorite product:

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "SELECT \
  users.name AS user, \
  products.name AS favorite \
  FROM users \
  INNER JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id"

mycursor.execute(sql)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
Note: You can use JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. They will both give you the same result.

LEFT JOIN
In the example above, Hannah, and Michael were excluded from the result, that is because INNER JOIN only shows the records where there is a match.

If you want to show all users, even if they do not have a favorite product, use the LEFT JOIN statement:

Example
Select all users and their favorite product:

sql = "SELECT \
  users.name AS user, \
  products.name AS favorite \
  FROM users \
  LEFT JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id"
RIGHT JOIN
If you want to return all products, and the users who have them as their favorite, even if no user have them as their favorite, use the RIGHT JOIN statement:

Example
Select all products, and the user(s) who have them as their favorite:

sql = "SELECT \
  users.name AS user, \
  products.name AS favorite \
  FROM users \
  RIGHT JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id"
Note: Hannah and Michael, who have no favorite product, are not included in the result.

#  PYTHON LAMBDA

#  A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

#   A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

#   SYNTAX
#     lambda arguments : expression
#     The expression is executed and the result is returned:

#   Example
#   A lambda function that adds 10 to the number passed in as an argument, and print the result:

x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))   #  15

x = lambda a : a 
print(x(5))   #  5

#    A lambda function that multiplies argument a with argument b and print the result:

x = lambda a, b : a * b
print(x(5, 6))    #  30

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))  #  13

#   Why Use Lambda Functions?
#   The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

#   Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:

def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)

print(mydoubler(11))     #   22
